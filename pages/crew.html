            Bob has been with us since 1997. Back then space traveling was only
            a big dream. But Bob dreamed big, quit his job at Starbucks and
            showed up on our doorstep every single day until 35 years later we
            could finally hire him. We entrusted him with the interior design of
            our first space shuttle. And what can we say? He invented the famous
            chameleon barf bags that matched the colour of your barf. And then
            he applied the same principle to our comfy loos.

            Hans is Austiran with Indian and Turkish roots and speaks seven
            earth languages on native level. If he compbines three of them he is
            able to understand most intergalactic radio communication and can
            translate from and into 3 different alien tongues: klingonic,
            alienic and Venusian dialect. Until google has developed their
            translation app to an inter planetarian level, Hans is our biggest
            asset. And: Don’t miss out on his Strudel!

            Diversity is part of our corporate philosophy. This is Monday. We
            don’t know his real name and until he learned our language we can
            only make guesses about his biography. Even though we cannot
            communicate with Monday, we love his sense of humor, how he dresses
            and the way he eats doves: he bites off their head first, like
            eating a chocolate easter bunny.
